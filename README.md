# Technical Writing Samples
This repository contains samples of my technical writings. These documents are based on "How-To" knowledge base articles that I wrote for the SAP Customer Data Cloud (CDC) product. The following articles provide users with accurate step-by-step instructions to resolve errors that are commonly reported. These articles also serve as references for the Support Team and help to deflect cases from getting escalated to the Development Team.
